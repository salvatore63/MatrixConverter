Description of operation

The system is managed by two independent routines that we could call power and rotating field.
The power supply routine is performed every 3.3msec (if the mains frequency is 50Hz) and is synchronized 
by a signal generated by the zero crossing of the concatenated voltage between the R-S phases. 
This routine simply has the task of signaling to the generation of the rotating field which is the pair 
of phases to be used in the next 3.3 msec. In the first three figures contained in the dwg file 
I have indicated the vectors of the mains voltages with respect to the star point and the concatenated ones, 
on the Vist axis you can read the instantaneous values of the voltages from the orthogonal projections of the relative vectors, 
in Fig.1 the case in which the power supply routine selects the phases at maximum voltage, 
in this case the execution of the routine with respect to the synchronism signal is delayed by ( PhaseSyn ) 1.666 msec with respect to the zero 
crossing of Vrs this means that at the generation routine of the rotating field the S and T phases will be signaled for the 3.3 msec 
in which the maximum voltage is established between these two phases, the average value of the voltage in this period of time (Vm) 
is approximately 500V with a difference between the minimum and maximum of about 72V , fig. 2 shows the case in which PhaseSyn = 3.3msec, 
the average voltage drops to 380V and the difference between the minimum and maximum values rises to about 260V, 
the Vm voltage drops further to 160V with a variation of 465V bringing PhaseSyn to 5msec as indicated in Fig.3
